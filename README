This Arduino GPX library provides a basic class to facilitate the creation of 
a valid GPX output.

Requirements:
  * Arduino 0019 or greater

Limitations:
  * Only a limited set of properties have been implemented at this time
  * To conserve memory each element should be serially retrieved and written to
    it's final location [read: sdcard/serialport/etc]

Install:
  To install copy the GPX/ directory into your arduino 'libraries' directory
  ie:
    cp -a GPX [/path/to/arduino]/libraries
